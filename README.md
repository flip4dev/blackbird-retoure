# Blackbird::Retoure

Blackbird::Retoure is a Ruby implementation of the DHL Retoure REST API.
The documentation of the API itself is located at: https://entwickler.dhl.de/group/ep/wsapis/retouren

Currently Blackbird::Retoure does support version 1.0 of the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'blackbird-retoure'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install blackbird-retoure

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can call the DHL Retoure API you need to set up your account according to https://entwickler.dhl.de/group/ep/wsapis/retouren/authentifizierung

Add an initializer to your application and configure the gem as follows:

```ruby
Blackbird::Retoure.configure do |config|
  config.username = 'Username of the system user'
  config.password = 'Password of the system user'
  config.app_token = 'Application token for production environment (CIG)'
  config.app_id = 'Application ID for production environment (CIG)'
  config.environment = :production
end
```
#### Sandbox
For `username` use your developer id of your developer account and for `password` the matching password of your developer account.

The settings for `app_token` and `app_id` doesn't need to be set in a sandbox environment.

#### Production
For `username` use your AppId and for the `password` use the one time token.

The settings for `app_token` and `app_id` have to be provided in a production environment. 

### Label creation

#### Data validation
The objects `Blackbird::Retoure::Country`, `Blackbird::Retoure::ReturnOrder` and `Blackbird::Retoure::ReturnOrder` as
well `Blackbord::Retoure::SimpleAddress` uses `ActiveModel::Validations` to ensure data validations.

Error messages can then be accessed by the `#error` method.

#### Minimum amount of data needed

```ruby
args = {
  receiver_id: 'DE',
  sender_address: {
    name1: 'Name #1',
    street_name: 'Street Name',
    house_number: 'House Number #',
    post_code: '12345',
    city: 'City',
    country: { country_iso_code: 'DEU' }
  }
}
```
#### Retrieve a single shipping label with the least amount of data.
```ruby
shipping_label = Blackbird::Retoure.shipping_label(args)
```
#### Just retrieve a QR code
```ruby 
qr_code = Blackbird::Retoure.qr_code(args)
```
#### Receive both documents (shipping label and qr code)
```ruby
both_documents = Blackbird::Retoure.both(args)
```
#### Return object
The DHL API returns a JSON object consisting of the following data:
```json
{
  "shipmentNumber": "Shipping number",
  "labelData": "Label data - base64 encoded",
  "qrLabelData": "QR label data - base64 encoded",
  "routingCode": "Routing code"
}
```
If an error happens you will receive a different structure:
```json
{
  "statusCode": "Error status code (e.g. 500)",
  "statusText": "Error message"
}
```

To process this data you have to manually parse it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

As the DHL API need a personal username and password for the Sandbox environment, duplicate the YAML file `spec/support/dev_environments/default.yml` and name it like your login user and change the default values in it. All files added to this directory will be ignored by commits.

Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Caveats

- Customs documents are currently not supported.
- A response class instead of passing of the Net::HTTP objects (tbd)
