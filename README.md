# Blackbird::Retoure

Blackbird::Retoure is a Ruby implementation of the DHL Retoure REST API.
The documentation of the API itself is located at: https://entwickler.dhl.de/group/ep/wsapis/retouren

Currently Blackbird::Retoure does support version 1.0 of the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'blackbird-retoure'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install blackbird-retoure

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can call the DHL Retoure API you need to set up your account according to https://entwickler.dhl.de/group/ep/wsapis/retouren/authentifizierung

Add an initializer to your application and configure the gem as follows:

```ruby
Blackbird::Retoure.configure do |config|
  config.username = 'Username of the system user'
  config.password = 'Password of the system user'
  config.app_token = 'Application token for production environment (CIG)'
  config.app_id = 'Application ID for production environment (CIG)'
  config.environment = :production
end
```
#### Sandbox
For `username` use your developer id of your developer account and for `password` the matching password of your developer account.

The settings for `app_token` and `app_id` doesn't need to be set in a sandbox environment.

#### Production
For `username` use your AppId and for the `password` use the one time token.

The settings for `app_token` and `app_id` have to be provided in a production environment. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

As the DHL API need a personal username and password for the Sandbox environment, duplicate the YAML file `spec/support/dev_environments/default.yml` and name it like your login user and change the default values in it. All files added to this directory will be ignored by commits.

Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Caveats

- Customs documents are currently not supported.
- A response class instead of passing of the Net::HTTP objects (tbd)
